# anguar2 sandbox

Sandbox temporary project. Nothing to see here. (i.e. will be constantly changing while I'm going through the Angular play by play on Pluralsight.)

## random notes

### hiding .js and .map files during development

1. install `peep` extension. (`@nwallace`) and configure hidden `.vscode\settings.json` as follows
 
 ```
{
  "typescript.check.workspaceVersion": false,
  "files.exclude": {
    "node_modules/": true,
    "dist/": true,
    "lib/": true,
    "app/*.js": true,
    "app/*.map":true
  }
}
 ```

1. reload vscode.
1. issue command (from command pallette) `peep none` or `peep all`


#### installing html test reporter

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor-jasmine2-html-reporter

1. `npm install protractor-jasmine2-html-reporter --save-dev`
1. update `protractor.config.js` (as per instructions in link above)
